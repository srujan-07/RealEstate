Real Estate System on Blockchain
The traditional real estate ecosystem is plagued by numerous challenges, including fraudulent land ownership claims, forged documentation, and a lack of transparency in property transactions. These issues not only result in financial losses but also erode trust among buyers, sellers, and regulatory authorities.

To address these problems, we propose the implementation of a blockchain-based real estate system. By leveraging the immutability, transparency, and decentralized verification offered by blockchain technology, we can ensure secure and tamper-proof land records, automate property transfers through smart contracts, and establish a single source of truth for ownership history. This solution aims to significantly reduce fraud, improve process efficiency, and enhance trust across the real estate sector.
